# Intro-to-Programming-Projects
This repository serves as a personal sandbox and practice ground for solidifying programming concepts, exploring new concepts, exploring new languages, and implementing algorithms from scratch.

These projects are primarily **self-driven exercises** designed to sharpen problem-solving skills and ensure proficiency in core programming constructs.

## 🛠️ Key Technologies & Focus Areas

* **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C++ (or list the languages you use most)
* **Concepts:** Data Structures (Lists, Stacks, Queues), Basic Algorithms, File I/O, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals.

## 📁 Project Index

Below is a curated list of practice projects and exercises. Each folder contains the source code and its own specific README for detailed context.

| Project Name | Language(s) | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Py-Simple-Task-Manager`** | Python | CLI application demonstrating file persistence and basic data structuring. | Complete |
| **`JS-Basic-DOM-Manipulation`** | JavaScript, HTML | Small web experiments focusing on event listeners and DOM updates. | Ongoing |
| **`C++-Data-Structure-Demos`** | C++ | Implementation of linked lists and binary search trees for practice. | Complete |
| **`Algorithm-Practice-Set-01`** | Python | Solutions to introductory algorithmic problems (e.g., FizzBuzz, reverse string, simple recursion). | Complete |

## 💡 Why This Repository?

This collection demonstrates my commitment to continuous learning and the ability to apply fundamental coding concepts quickly and accurately in an independent environment.
